# Data Quality Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing data quality issues in a given dataset. The goal is to identify inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and other potential issues that impact data reliability. The analysis is conducted using **Python** and visualized with tools like **Power BI** or Matplotlib.

## 📂 Dataset  
- **File:** `data_quality_issues.csv`  
- **Contents:** Contains raw data with potential quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, incorrect formats, and inconsistencies.  
- **Source:** [Provide dataset source if applicable]

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Power BI** (Optional, for visualization)  

## 📌 Key Features  
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies)  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for quality assessment  
- Statistical insights into data issues  
- Data visualization to highlight key problem areas  

## 📊 Results & Insights  
- Summary of missing values and duplicates  
- Detection of inconsistent or incorrect data  
- Suggested methods to improve data quality  

## 🏗️ Future Improvements  
- Automating data quality checks with scripts  
- Integrating with Power BI dashboards  
- Enhancing data validation techniques
